Transfers to such Account revenues resulting from the temporary 50% increase in the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate and the corporate environmental income tax.\n\nRequires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to report to Congress annually on the progress of response actions funded by the Hazardous Substance Superfund."
