Directs the Federal Election Commission to establish an Audit Guidelines Development Task Force to assist the Commission in developing model audit guidelines.\n\nPrescribes election security requirements for voting systems, including: (1) chain of custody protocols; (2) disclosure of election-dedicated software; and (3) minimum state standards to ensure the integrity of the voting process and education and training of poll workers.\n\nEstablishes accreditation requirements for laboratories involved in testing of voting system hardware and software. Directs the Commission to establish the Testing Escrow Account for payments to accredited laboratories for testing of such hardware and software.\n\nRequires the Commission to make grants for: (1) development and testing of new voting systems, technologies, and innovations to meet independent verification requirements under this Act; and (2) pilot programs for such testing.\n\nDirects the Commission to establish a task force to study and develop recommendations regarding the appropriate level of funding for requirements payments.\n\nAmends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act to prohibit state refusal to accept voter registration and absentee ballot applications and federal write-in absentee ballots for failure to meet nonessential requirements."
