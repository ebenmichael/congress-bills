Accuracy in Fuel Economy Standards Act - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to calculate maximum feasible fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles and non-passenger automobiles based on the most recent high gasoline price projection issued by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Defines the "applicable high gasoline price projection" as the greatest of a range of estimated gasoline prices that the EIA issues as part of its annual energy outlook, short-term energy outlook, or similar analyses for: (1) the year (or years) corresponding to the model year (or model years) for which the Secretary is prescribing an average fuel economy standard; and (2) the range of years considered by the Secretary in determining the costs and benefits associated with such standard.</summary>
