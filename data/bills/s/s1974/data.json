Makes such provision effective for payments due after August 2007.\n\n(Sec. 12) Prohibits states from reducing unemployment compensation by the amount of pension rollovers.\n\n(Sec. 13) Modifies the formula for determining inclusion in gross income of distributions from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for charitable purposes.\n\n(Sec. 14) Provides that the value of assets for any ERISA plan under the averaging method shall be adjusted for contributions, distributions, and expected earnings as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nProvides for an alternative method of meeting the definition of qualified optional survivor annuity.\n\n(Sec. 15) Makes the amendments made by this Act effective as if originally included in the Pension Protection Act of 2006."
