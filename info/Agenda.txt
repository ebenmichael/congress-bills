1.	Data gathering (led by Eli)
	⁃	house bills, roll call data, caucus membership
2.	Empirical motivation + exploratory data analysis (led by Bryan)
	⁃	clustering/dimensionality reduction on the roll call data
	⁃	run IPM (ideal point model)
	⁃	demonstrate that caucuses matter 
		⁃	simple way: run IPM on the roll call data, “color” the inferred legislator vectors X_u according to caucus and see if the colors cluster
		⁃	if that doesn’t work, you could: run the single-membership SBM on the caucus data, then run IPM on the roll call data, but with X_u | F_u = k ~ N(mu_k, 1) (that is, each faction k getting its own mean vector) and see if that gives a better predictive performance than IPM with a single mu
	⁃	demonstrate that stochastic block model matters
	⁃	could use suggestion above, but in general want to answer whether the inferred factions tell us anything about the votes
3.	inference related derivations
4.	implement VI-stitching (led by Jake and Eli)
