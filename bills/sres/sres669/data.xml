  <summary>9/22/2008--Introduced.
Recognizes efforts to educate, support, and provide hope for the Hispanic community, including efforts to: (1) honor outstanding Hispanic scientists in the United States at the annual National Hispanic Scientist of the Year Gala; and (2) motivate Hispanic youth to study science through "Meet the Hispanic Scientist Day," an opportunity for them to meet the honoree of the National Hispanic Scientist of the Year Award.

Congratulates the 2008 National Hispanic Scientist of the Year (Dr. Lydia Villa-Komaroff), designated by the Museum of Science &amp; Industry, for ongoing dedication to improving the quality of, and access to, science and engineering research and education.</summary>
