  <summary>1/4/2007--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States has the inherent right to defend itself against imminent or actual attack, as codified in the Charter of the United Nations and embodied in the traditions of international law, but that right does not extend to undertaking military action in the absence of such an imminent or actual attack.

 Disavows the doctrine of preemption because it poses a threat to international law and to U.S. national security interests.</summary>
