  <summary>8/1/2008--Introduced.
Food Tracking Improvement Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit failing to comply with any requirement of this Act.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish a traceability system for all stages of manufacturing, processing, packaging, and distribution of food; and (2) convene an advisory committee to assist in implementing the system. Requires the system to identify each article of food shipped in interstate commerce in a manner that enables the Secretary to retrieve the history, use, and location of the article through a recordkeeping and audit system, a secure, online database, or registered identification.

Authorizes the Secretary to direct each person required to identify an article of food to maintain accurate records regarding the purchase, sale, and identification of the article. Requires each such person to allow authorized representatives of the Secretary to examine and copy records. Prohibits any person from: (1) falsifying or misrepresenting information as to the location at which any article of food was held; or (2) altering, detaching, or destroying any records or other means of identification for use in determining such a location.</summary>
