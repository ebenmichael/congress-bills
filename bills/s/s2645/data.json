Requires promulgation of a final rule establishing enforceable uniform national discharge standards modeled on the regulatory program for vessels of the Armed Forces and based upon the best available technology.\n\nPreempts related state and local laws regarding a discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, subject to exception.\n\nLists certain discharges that are unaffected by or excluded from this Act, including Armed Forces vessels, discharges of vessel sewage, and discharges related to aquatic nuisance species.\n\nMakes this Act, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the exclusive statutory authority for federal regulation of vessel discharges to which these provisions apply."
