  <summary>12/23/2008--Public Law.
Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), notwithstanding any other provision of law, to develop and implement a program to encourage and permit, to the extent technically feasible, the continued broadcasting in the analog television service of specified public safety information and digital television transition information for 30 days after the transition.

Requires the FCC, in designing the program, to consider certain factors, including: (1) taking into account market-by-market needs; (2) avoiding digital signal interference; and (3) already-adopted transition and coordination plans.

Prohibits: (1) analog broadcasting on any spectrum that is approved or pending approval for public safety radio services; and (2) including the analog spectrum between channels 52 and 69 reclaimed from analog television broadcasting.</summary>
