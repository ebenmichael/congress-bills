  <summary>8/3/2007--Introduced.
Private Prison Information Act of 2007 - Provides that each nongovernmental entity contracting with the federal government to incarcerate or detain federal prisoners or detainees in a privately-owned prison or other detention facility shall have the same duty to release information about the operation of that facility as a federal agency operating such a facility would have under the Freedom of Information Act. Authorizes any party aggrieved by a violation of that duty to obtain relief in a civil action.</summary>
