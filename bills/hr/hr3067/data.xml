  <summary>7/30/2007--Passed House amended.
Small Public Housing Authority Act - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to exempt a small public housing agency from the requirement to prepare an annual public agency plan if the agency: (1) administers not more than a total of 250 dwelling units and section 8 vouchers; and (2) is not a troubled agency.

Requires an agency to: (1) continue to make an annual civil rights certification, and establish, and consult with, one or more resident advisory boards; and (2) conduct a public hearing to discuss agency goals and policies, and make the information available to the public at the agency's principal office.

Declares that qualified small public housing agencies are not exempt from the requirements for amendments and modifications to five-year public housing agency plans.
