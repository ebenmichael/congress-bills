Requires the Director of the Office to: (1) provide for the protection of human research subjects; (2) establish criteria regarding assurance of compliance with Common Rule requirements; and (3) coordinate federal activities with respect to the protection of human research subjects. Authorizes the Director to make grants for a model education program.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) promulgate regulations enhancing the protection of people with diminished decisionmaking capacity participating in human subject research; and (2) study whether the number of certain members of Institutional Review Boards should be increased."
