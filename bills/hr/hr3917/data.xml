  <summary>10/22/2007--Introduced.
Coinage Efficiency Act of 2007 - Declares that specified authority of the Director of the U.S. Mint shall cease to apply, and shall have no force or effect, with respect to one-cent coins.

Denies the Secretary of the Treasury authority to prescribe any regulations that would limit or prohibit the export, melting, or treatment of the one-cent coin until such time as the Secretary first issues a one-cent coin with a different metallic content than the one-cent coins issued as of the date of enactment of this Act.</summary>
