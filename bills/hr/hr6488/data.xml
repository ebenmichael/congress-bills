  <summary>7/14/2008--Introduced.
Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to declare any novelty lighter to be a banned hazardous product under the Consumer Product Safety Act and promulgate a final consumer product safety rule to carry out this Act. Defines "novelty lighter" as a mechanical or electrical device that is typically used to light cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, is designed to appear to be a toy (such as by flashing lights or making sounds), and contains such other factors as the CPSC may determine.</summary>
