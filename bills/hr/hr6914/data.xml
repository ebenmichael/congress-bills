  <summary>9/16/2008--Introduced.
Renewable Energy Tax Extenders Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend through 2018 the tax credit for producing electricity from certain renewable resources (e.g., wind, biomass, solar energy, small irrigation power, landfill gas, trash combustion, and hydropower facilities). Includes marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as a renewable resource for purposes of such credit.

Extends through 2018: (1) the energy tax credit for solar energy, fuel cell, and microturbine property; and (2) the tax credit for residential energy efficient property expenditures. Allows a 30% residential energy efficiency tax credit for the installation of geothermal heat pump systems.

Extends through 2018 the alternative motor vehicle tax credit. Eliminates the limitation on the number of new qualified hybrid and advanced lean-burn technology vehicles eligible for such credit.</summary>
